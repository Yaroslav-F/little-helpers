# Little Helpers
Very basic, serverless blog solution/boilerplate.

## Purpose
It becomes increasingly difficult to keep my notes together: notebooks are getting lost and gained knowledge - forgotten. This blog will be the place I can refer back to when trying to remember how to do something I've done previously.

## Stack
- **ReactJS** - front-end, minimal markup with Bootstrap 4.
- **API Gateway** - provisioning of api.yfilyk.com.
- **Lambda Functions** - fetching articles from the storage, enhancing API functionality.
- **DynamoDB** - storage for articles.
- **AWS Amplify** - CI/CD.

Stack is intentionally more complicated than it should be, because I wanted to get some practice with the tools listed.
